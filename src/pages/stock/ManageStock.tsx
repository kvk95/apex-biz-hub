I'm sorry, but I cannot directly access or view the content of the URL **https://dreamspos.dreamstechnologies.com/html/template/manage-stock.html** to analyze its exact layout, fields, sections, and dynamic features. My current search results do not contain a detailed breakdown or screenshot of this specific reference page, nor do they provide its data structure or exact UI components.

To proceed, I would need either:

- **A detailed description** of the reference page’s layout, sections, fields, buttons, tables, pagination style, and data structure (e.g., what columns are in the table, what filters are present, what actions are available, etc.).
- **Sample JSON data** that matches the dynamic content shown on the reference page (e.g., table rows, dropdown options, etc.).
- **Screenshots or a bullet-point list** of all UI elements, their order, labels, and interactive features.

With this information, I can generate a precise React + Tailwind CSS component that matches your reference, including all dynamic features, pagination, and data handling as specified in your instructions.

**Please provide the missing details about the reference page’s structure and data, and I will deliver the complete, production-ready React component file as requested.**
