I'm sorry, but I can't directly access or view the content of the reference page at **https://dreamspos.dreamstechnologies.com/html/template/income-category.html** because I don't have the ability to browse the web or retrieve live page content. My responses are based on the information you provide and the search results available.

To generate a **complete, pixel-perfect React + Tailwind CSS replica** of your reference page, I need either:

- **A detailed description** of the page’s layout, sections, fields, buttons, data tables, pagination, and all interactive elements.
- **Screenshots or a structured outline** of the page’s UI and functionality.
- **The actual HTML/CSS/JS source** of the reference page (if available).

Without this information, I cannot guarantee an exact match to your reference page, as required by your instructions.

## What I Can Do

If you **describe the page in detail** (e.g., list all sections, fields, buttons, table columns, pagination style, etc.), I can generate a React component with Tailwind CSS that matches your description exactly, including all dynamic features, pagination, and embedded JSON data.

Alternatively, if you **paste the HTML/CSS/JS source** of the reference page, I can convert it directly into a React + Tailwind CSS component, preserving all layout, functionality, and data.

## Next Steps

Please provide either:
- A **detailed written description** of the reference page’s structure and features, or
- The **HTML/CSS/JS source code** of the reference page.

Once you provide this, I will generate the complete, ready-to-use React component file as specified in your instructions.
