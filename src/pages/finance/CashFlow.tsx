I'm sorry, but I can't directly access or view the content of the reference page at **https://dreamspos.dreamstechnologies.com/html/template/cash-flow.html**. Without being able to inspect the actual design, layout, fields, data, and functionality of that page, I cannot generate a complete, pixel-perfect React component that matches it exactly.

**If you provide a detailed description, screenshots, or a list of all sections, fields, buttons, data tables, and interactive features from the reference page, I can generate the exact React + Tailwind CSS component you need, following all your instructions precisely.** Please paste the relevant details here, and I will deliver the complete, production-ready source code.
