I'm unable to directly access or view the content of the reference page at **dreamspos.dreamstechnologies.com/html/template/pos-orders.html** due to technical restrictions. Without the ability to inspect the exact layout, fields, sections, data, and interactive features of the reference page, I cannot generate a pixel-perfect, fully functional React component that matches your requirements.

## What I Can Provide

If you **provide a detailed description** of the reference page—including screenshots, a list of sections, fields, buttons, table columns, pagination UI, and sample data—I can generate a complete, production-ready React component using Tailwind CSS that exactly matches your specifications.

Alternatively, if you can **paste the HTML/CSS/JS source** of the reference page here, I can parse it and convert it into a React + Tailwind component with all dynamic features, pagination, and data handling as described in your task.

## Next Steps

- **Please provide the HTML/CSS/JS source** of the reference page, **or** a detailed breakdown of its structure, fields, and data.
- If you have screenshots, upload them or describe the layout, colors, and interactive elements in detail.
- Specify any API endpoints or data fetching logic if the page loads data dynamically.

Once you provide this information, I will generate the exact React + Tailwind CSS component you need, with all functionality, pagination, and data structures included, following your instructions precisely.
